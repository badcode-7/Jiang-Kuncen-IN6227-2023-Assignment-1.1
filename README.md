Performance Evaluation and Analysis of a Self-implemented Decision Tree Classification Model for Predicting Income

In this project, the decision tree is implemented by ID3 and C4.5 algorithms, and the test set is predicted and the model performance is evaluated.

The time complexity generated by this decision tree is usually on the order of O(NM^2D), where N is the size of the data set, M is the number of features, and D is the depth of the decision tree.

The main.py file is the training and generation part of the final optimal decision tree, using the C4.5 algorithm.

The ID3.py file uses the ID3 algorithm to generate the decision tree as a comparison.

The predict.py file verifies the test set, including the prediction function of the decision tree, the calculation function of the decision tree performance indicators and the visualization of the performance indicators. 

The optimazation.py file iteratively searches for the optimal maximum depth of the decision tree, and observes the performance indicators of the decision tree at each depth.

The my_tree.json file contains the final decision tree.
